<p><b>General Conditions</b></p>

<p>1. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Sightings service for any reason, without notice at any time.</p>

<p>2. We reserve the right to alter these Terms of Use at any time.

What constitutes a "material change" will be determined at our sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgement.</p>

<p>3. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

<p><b>Proprietary Rights in Content on Sightings</b></p>

<p>1. Sightings does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the Sightings Services. By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Sightings Services, you hereby grant to Sightings a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly ("private") will not be distributed outside the Sightings Services.</p>

<p>2. Some of the Sightings Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Sightings may place such advertising and promotions on the Sightings Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>

<p>3. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Sightings Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Sightings Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the Sightings Services.</p>

<p>4. The Sightings Services contain Content of Sightings ("Sightings Content"). Sightings Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and Sightings owns and retains all rights in the Sightings Content and the Sightings Services. Sightings hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Sightings Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the Sightings Services.</p>

<p>5. The Sightings Services contain Content of Users and other Sightings licensors. Except as provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the Sightings Services.</p>

<p>6. Sightings performs technical functions necessary to offer the Sightings Services, including but not limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Sightings Services.</p>

<p>Although the Site and other Sightings Services are normally available, there will be occasions when the Site or other Sightings Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of Sightings. Also, although Sightings will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, Sightings reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by Sightings in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Sightings encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Sightings is not a backup service. Sightings will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Sightings Services, or the loss of any Content. </p>

	    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	    <p> </p>

<p>Nymbly, Inc. ("Nymbly") operates several websites including sightin.gs, sight.gs, and nymb.ly. It is Nymbly's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<p><b>Website Visitors</b></p>

<p>Like most website operators, Nymbly collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Nymbly's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Nymbly's visitors use its website. From time to time, Nymbly may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Nymbly also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Nymbly posts. Nymbly only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<p><b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</b></p>

<p>Certain visitors to Nymbly's websites choose to interact with Nymbly in ways that require Nymbly to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Nymbly gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account on http://sightin.gs to provide a username and email address. In each case, Nymbly collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Nymbly. Nymbly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<p><b>Aggregated Statistics</b></p>

<p>Nymbly may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Nymbly may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Nymbly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<p><b>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</b></p>

<p>Nymbly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Nymbly's behalf or to provide services available at Nymbly's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Nymbly's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Nymbly will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Nymbly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Nymbly believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Nymbly, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Nymbly website and have supplied your email address, Nymbly may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Nymbly and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Nymbly takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Nymbly uses cookies to help Nymbly identify and track visitors, their usage of Nymbly website, and their website access preferences. Nymbly visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Nymbly's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Nymbly's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<p><b>Ads</b></p>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Nymbly and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b></p>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Nymbly may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Nymbly's sole discretion. Nymbly encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
